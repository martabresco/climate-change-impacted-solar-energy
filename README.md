# Climate-Change-Impacted Solar Energy Generation
This project analyzes how solar energy generation across Europe is affected by climate change, using satellite data (SARAH-3), reanalysis (ERA5) and climate model data (CMIP6). It includes bias correction, capacity factor (CF) calculations, temperature effects, and energy drought statistics.

> **Note:** Data files (`.nc`, `.csv`) are not included in the GitHub repository. They are stored in Sophia (/groups/EXTREMES/s233224/)

## Codes

All codes used to generate the results, uploaded to Github repository

- **regridding_functions.py**: auxiliary functions to average ERA5, SARAH-3 and CMIP6 variables for bias correction, regridding function (based on Andrea's work), returns regridder  
- **bias_correction.py**: to obtain bias factor per model and component in original grid. Includes the two step bias correction. Requires a `.nc` with 0.3 grid and auxiliary regridding functions  

- **pv_functions.py**: contains `SolarPosition` (change in time index handling), `get_orientation`, `make_latitude_optimal`, `surface_orientation`, `diffuseHorizontalIrrad`, `TiltedDiffuseIrrad`, `TiltedDirectIrrad`, `TiltedGroundIrrad` (takes albedo regridded to each model's grid), `TiltedIrrad` (main change: redefining `influx_toa`, `influx direct` and `influx diffuse`)  
- **power_calculation.py**: code to transform from the CMIP6 yearly files to solar CF. Handles the calendar standarization and includes the multiplication by the bias factors. Uses the pv functions from atlite modified as necessary in `pv_functions.py`. After CF has been calculated, it is multiplied ×3 to represent all power in the period. Results for every 3h and yearly aggregation are saved as `.nc`  
- **aggregated_CF_values.py**: perform annual or seasonal aggregation of solar CF (with or without temp effect)  
- **power_era5_yearly.py**: obtain yearly solar CF from ERA5
